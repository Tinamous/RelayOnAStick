Relay On A Stick
================
USB Stick with a Particle Photon driving a single relay.

USB A Plug is optional, may be powered from USB Micro B on the Photon.

Small, simple Internet of Things relay.

PCB has cutout and large seperation around relay contacts which should help high voltages but suitability for use should be determined by the user before connecting - Don't use metal screws!

Relay - Songle SRD-05VDC-SL-C (from eBay).



Currently totally untested!
